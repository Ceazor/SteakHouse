What is the Steakhouse?

The steakhouse is a token reward gauge that accepts rewards and gives them to all users that deposit STEAK in it. These rewards will start out being the trading fees from the STEAK pair on aerodrome but other tokens could be added.

Is there a lock time?

When a user deposits their $STEAK into the steakhouse their tokens are locked for 14 days. After 14 days they can withdraw from the steakhouse. During this time they will receive their share of the rewards. 

What if I have STEAK in the steakhouse and I deposit more?

If you already have $STEAK staked in the steakhouse and you stake more STEAK this will reset your lock time to 14 days if and only if your lock is still active. So if you stake 100 STEAK, it is locked for 14 days, but if you stake another 50 STEAK before 14 days is over, then all 150 STEAK will be relocked for 14 days. But if you stake more $STEAK after the 14 days then the original STEAK will not be relocked

What is Season The Steak?
